I have the following components:
1. Maven 3
2. Web Application
3. Java 21
4. Tomcat 9
5. Windows 11
I do the following steps to deploy my application to Tomcat:
1. I execute "mvn clean" command to remove target folder.
2. I execute "mvn package" command to build the project and healthcare.war artifact is created.
3. I stop Tomcat if it is running.
4. I delete "work" folder in Tomcat's directory.
5. I delete "logs" folder in Tomcat's directory.
6. I delete all content in "webapps/healthcare" directory in Tomcat's directory.
7. I unarchive healthcare.war artifact to "webapps/healthcare" directory in Tomcat's directory.
8. I start the Tomcat.
You must implement deployment script.
This script must include the following steps:
1. Execute "mvn clean" command to remove target folder.
2. Execute "mvn package" command to build the project and healthcare.war artifact must be created.
3. If Tomcat is running the stop Tomcat.
4. Delete "work" folder in Tomcat's directory.
5. Delete "logs" folder in Tomcat's directory.
6. Delete all content in "webapps/healthcare" directory in Tomcat's directory.
7. Unarchive healthcare.war artifact to "webapps/healthcare" directory in Tomcat's directory.
8. Start the Tomcat.
I want to run this script on Windows machine from CMD.
